I am a developer of many big projects and made this for fun.

Took me around 2-3 weeks to code so yea LOL. Basically its a;
Offline Model Loading: Crucially, the code now uses from_pretrained to load the model without relying on an internet connection. The try...except block is vital to handle the initial download if the model isn't already cached. It also suggests what to do if you are still having issues loading the model offline. You can use local_files_only=True during model loading if you've already downloaded it previously. You can download a model using transformers-cli download <model_name>
Smaller Model: I switched to gpt2 as the default because it's relatively small. You can experiment with other small models. Crucially, adjust max_length and other generation parameters to suit the model's capabilities.
Agent Class: The Agent class encapsulates the agent's role, knowledge, personality, and importantly, its memory. The generate_prompt method creates context-rich prompts for the language model, incorporating role, knowledge, and conversation history.
AgentSwarm Coordinator: The AgentSwarm class manages the agents and orchestrates their interaction.
Threading for Concurrency: The AgentSwarm.orchestrate method now uses threading to allow agents to generate responses concurrently. This significantly speeds up the process compared to a sequential approach. A queue.Queue is used to safely collect responses from the threads.
Lock for Shared Resources: A threading.Lock is used to protect the conversation_history when multiple agents are writing to it, preventing race conditions.
Response Aggregation: A basic form of response aggregation is implemented. In a real system, you'd want a more sophisticated method to combine the agents' outputs (e.g., summarization, voting, or another agent acting as a "chief editor").
Conversation History: The AgentSwarm maintains a conversation_history that is passed to each agent, allowing them to be aware of the context of the interaction.
Error Handling: Includes a try...except block for model loading to provide more informative error messages.
Clearer Comments: Added more comments to explain the purpose of each code section.
How to Run:install libraries

Run the Code: Execute the Python script. The first time you run it, it will download the model files (if they are not already cached). Subsequent runs will use the cached files.
Important Considerations and Next Steps:

Offline Knowledge Base: Implement a real offline knowledge base for your agents. This could involve loading data from text files, JSON files, or using a local vector database (like FAISS or ChromaDB) with pre-computed embeddings for offline retrieval. (This is a major area for improvement). Fine-tuning the model on your specific knowledge base is highly recommended.
Agent Selection: Improve the agent selection logic. Instead of random selection, consider using a mechanism to choose agents based on the user's input or the current state of the conversation (e.g., using keywords or topic modeling).
Response Aggregation: Implement a more sophisticated response aggregation strategy. Consider using a dedicated "aggregator" agent that summarizes or synthesizes the responses from other agents.
Memory Management: The agent's memory will grow indefinitely. Implement a mechanism to prune or summarize the memory to prevent it from becoming too large. Consider using a sliding window or a more sophisticated summarization technique.
Fine-tuning: Fine-tune the language model on a dataset that is relevant to the agents' roles and knowledge. This will significantly improve the quality of the generated text. Use tools like transformers Trainer to fine-tune the models. You'll need a good dataset for fine-tuning.
Hardware: Even with smaller models, you'll likely need a decent amount of RAM (at least 8GB, preferably more) and a reasonably powerful CPU. A GPU will significantly speed up the text generation process.
Quantization: Consider using quantization techniques to reduce the memory footprint of the model. Libraries like torch.quantization can help with this.
Alternative Models: Explore other small language models that are designed for offline use, such as those from the Hugging Face Model Hub. Be aware that even the smallest models can be quite large.
This is a complex project, but this framework provides a solid foundation for building your offline AI agent swarm. Remember to start small, iterate often, and be prepared to invest significant time and effort. Good luck!

























ps: if you got this far im a core dev of the Solana team.
